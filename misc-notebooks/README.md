# Old and Ancillary Notebooks

The `baseline-models` notebook has older and less comparable models to the rest of the project. Since it's also only trained on a fraction of the data, I've included it here with the older fenpreprocessing it needs to run.

The presentation and rollout notebooks were temporary useful notebooks included here for reproducibility. They likely need to be moved into the main directory to do the imports correctly, but since they only produce presentation images and allow basic interactive play, it likely won't be necessary to run these.
